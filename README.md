# WebPipe - slim WebSocket library #

### Why another? ###

This pretty much sums it up:

* socket.io 97 kiB
* sockjs 57 kiB
* webpipe **3.7 kiB**

Above sizes are minified.

### Dependencies ###

WebPipe have only one dependency: 

* An `EventEmitter` class with standard methods: `.on()`, `.off()` and `.emit()`.

[MicroEmitter](http://notes.jetienne.com/2011/03/22/microeventjs.html) works just fine.
